  Da new shtick: verification now a two-step assymetric process.
  
  A single 'verified/reconstructed' data segment cache, and then the
  multiple fragment cache 

  verify a newly read block against previous blocks; do it only this
  once. We maintain a list of 'verified sections' from these matches.

  We then glom these verified areas into a new data buffer.
  Defragmentation fixups are allowed here alone.

  We also now track where read boundaries actually happened; do not
  verify across matching boundaries.

  Silence.  "It's BAAAAAAaaack."

  audio is now treated as great continents of values floating on a
  mantle of molten silence.  Silence is not handled by basic
  verification at all; we simply anchor sections of nonzero audio to a
  position and fill in everything else as silence.  We also note the
  audio that interfaces with silence; an edge must be 'wet'.

  **************************************************************/

/* ===========================================================================
 * Let's translate the above vivid metaphor into something a mere mortal
 * can understand:
 *
 * Non-silent audio is "solid."  Silent audio is "wet" and fluid.  The reason
 * to treat silence as fluid is that if there's a long enough span of
 * silence, we can't reliably detect jitter or dropped samples within that
 * span (since all silence looks alike).  Non-silent audio, on the other
 * hand, is distinctive and can be reliably reassembled.
 *
 * So we treat long spans of silence specially.  We only consider an edge
 * of a non-silent region ("continent" or "island") to be "wet" if it borders
 * a long span of silence.  Short spans of silence are merely damp and can
 * be reliably placed within a continent.
 *
 * We position ("anchor") the non-silent regions somewhat arbitrarily (since
 * they may be jittered and we have no way to verify their exact position),
 * and fill the intervening space with silence.
 *
 * See i_silence_match() for the gory details.

  /* Mark verified samples as "verified," but trim the verified region
   * by OVERLAP_ADJ samples on each side.  There are several significant
   * implications of this trimming:
   *
   * 1) Why we trim at all:  We have to trim to distinguish between two
   * adjacent verified runs and one long verified run.  We encounter this
   * situation when samples have been dropped:
   *
   *   matched portion of read 1 ....)(.... matched portion of read 1
   *       read 2 adjacent run  .....)(..... read 2 adjacent run
   *                                 ||
   *                      dropped samples in read 2
   *
   * So at this point, the fact that we have two adjacent runs means
   * that we have not yet verified that the two runs really are adjacent.
   * (In fact, just the opposite:  there are two runs because they were
   * matched by separate runs, indicating that some samples didn't match
   * across the length of read 2.)
   *
   * If we verify that they are actually adjacent (e.g. if the two runs
   * are simply a result of matching runs from different reads, not from
   * dropped samples), we will indeed mark them as one long merged run.
   *
   * 2) Why we trim by this amount: We want to ensure that when we
   * verify the relationship between these two runs, we do so with
   * an overlapping fragment at least OVERLAP samples long.  Following
   * from the above example:
   *
   *                (..... matched portion of read 3 .....)
   *       read 2 adjacent run  .....)(..... read 2 adjacent run
   *
   * Assuming there were no dropped samples between the adjacent runs,
   * the matching portion of read 3 will need to be at least OVERLAP
   * samples long to mark the two runs as one long verified run.
   * If there were dropped samples, read 3 wouldn't match across the
   * two runs, proving our caution worthwhile.
   *
   * 3) Why we partially discard the work we've done:  We don't.
   * When subsequently creating verified fragments from this run,
   * we compensate for this trimming.  Thus the verified fragment will
   * contain the full length of verified samples.  Only the c_blocks
   * will reflect this trimming.

 * number.  The sectors come come from multiple low-level read requests.
 *
 * This function reads many sectors in order to exhaust any caching on the
 * drive itself, as caching would simply return the same incorrect data
 * over and over.  Paranoia depends on truly re-reading portions of the
 * disc to make sure the reads are accurate and correct any inaccuracies.
 *
 * Which precise sectors are read varies ("jiggles") between calls to
 * read_c_block, to prevent consistent errors across multiple reads
 * from being misinterpreted as correct data.
 *
 * The size of each low-level read is determined by the underlying driver
 * (p->d->nsectors), which allows the driver to specify how many sectors
 * can be read in a single request.  Historically, the Linux kernel could
 * only read 8 sectors at a time, with likely dropped samples between each
 * read request.  Other operating systems may have different limitations.
 *
 * This function is called by paranoia_read_limited(), which breaks the
 * c_block of read data into runs of samples that are likely to be
 * contiguous, verifies them and stores them in verified fragments, and
 * eventually merges the fragments into the verified root.
