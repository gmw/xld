  /* Some assumptions about timing: 

     We can't perform cache determination timing based on looking at
     average transfer times; on slow setups, the speed of a drive
     reading sectors via PIO will not be reliably distinguishable from
     the same drive returning data from the cache via pio.  We need
     something even more noticable and reliable: the seek time. It is
     unlikely we'd ever see a seek latency of under ~10ms given the
     synchronization requirements of a CD and the maximum possible
     rotational velocity. A cache hit would always be faster, even
     with PIO.

     Further complicating things, we have to watch the data collection
     carefully as we're not always going to be on an unloaded system,
     and we even have to guard against other apps accessing the drive
     (something that should never happen on purpose, but could happen
     by accident).  As we know in our testing when seeks should never
     occur, a sudden seek-sized latency popping up in the middle of a
     collection is an indication that collection is possibly invalid.

     A second cause of 'spurious latency' would be media damage; if
     we're consistently hitting latency on the same sector during
     initial collection, may need to move past it. */
